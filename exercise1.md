When coding the project with Python, one could use PyLint for linting, unittest for testing and setuptools for building the package. PyLint and unittest seem to work similarly to their JavaScript counterparts, but building the project to a package is a bit different. The package would be built based on a setup.py file, where all the instructions about the building would go.

Alternatives for setting up CI in Python are TravisCI, CodeShip and Semaphore. These products are all self-hosted, but if we needed a cloud-based alternative, we could use AWS CodePipeline, Microsoft Team Foundation Server or Oracle's Hudson.

Choosing self-hosted over cloud-based depends a lot on the project. The development team is quite small, so a cloud-based solution could work just fine. However, if building the project requires a lot of resources, for example a graphics card, a self-hosted CI setup would be better. Also, a self-hosted setup would be better if our development team would work with other teams in the future, or the development team is expanding soon. In our case the self-hosted option would be better, if the team size stays small and no heavy computing resources are required. The self-hosted option is better in this case, because it it cheaper and a lot quicker to set up.
